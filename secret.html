    <h1>Our Love Story ðŸ’œ</h1>
    <p>
      I came to your school, Bishop Wainaina(Sijui kama nimespell poa) I was with my mom, 
      And you were going to the toilet, and you saw me, you saw a cute guy, 
      Little did you know, that we'd become the best couple in both our families. 
      My first day in that class, I sat next to someone, I can't remember who, but I sat next to someone,
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I was moved to sit next to those two girls,
      I never saw them, I saw you, even though I was behing you on the left side,
      We still saw each other, and we fell in love.
      We wasted not time, on the first Saturday, we started dating.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was weird but it was us.
      I went back to my old school, and on December of that year, we broke up.
      But we couldn't let go of each other, we got back together, this year on
      1st September 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our love story is very complicated,
      But so are we, no one is perfect, 
      I love you baby, 
      From your man, 
    </p>

      <p>
        From the moment we met, my heart knew,<br>
        The world felt warmer because of you.<br>
        Through every laugh, through every tear,<br>
        Iâ€™ll love you more with every year. ðŸ’œ
